* PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
* GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
* Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
* Redis: Used for caching and session management.
* Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
* CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
### üë• Team Roles
* Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
* Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
